#summary Introduction to the package and table of contents.

= Introduction =

Welcome! This package consists of many convenience functions to perform a variety of statistical analysis of metabolomics data. The methods are not limited to metabolomics data alone and should be applicable to any numerical data matrix, but the most important data that I have access to is metabolomics. The main purpose of writing this package is to make my own life easy in my daily life of data analysis. This package wouldn't exist without R community. I am obviously indebted to the developers of R, Bioconductor and developers of the many R packages!

This package is only available in source code format. There is no binary package in the standard R package style. The way to use this package is therefore to just download the sources, source the scripts that you need and use the functions there in. The best place to start getting familiar with the package is the 'examples' folder. I will keep adding more and more examples whenever I get some free time. I will soon update this page to list all the functions of this package.

Capabilities of this package are listed here.
==Data import==
  * [ReadingTheData Input of metabolomics data sets] (well, any numerical data set will work) and their meta data in Bioconductor {{{ExpressionSet}}} format.
==Univariate statistics & statistical hypothesis tests==
  * One-way anova and post-hoc test (Tukey Honestly Significant Differences).
  * Two-way anova and post-hoc test (Tukey Honestly Significant Differences).
  * T-test for each variable in the data set.
  * Fold changes for each variable in the data set.
  * Area under the ROC curve for each variable in the data set.
  * Correlation of each variable with a selected variable of interest.
  * Correlation between every pair of variables in a data set.
  * Correlation between variables in two data sets (i.e. every variable in data set 1 versus every variable in data set 2)
==Graphics==
  * Box plots, bean plots, and bar plots
  * Principal component analysis
  * Hierarchical clustering dendrogram
==Classification & regression models==
  * A classification model using logistic regression
  * A classification model using random forest
  * Evaluation of prediction performance of a logistic regression using cross validation
  * Evaluation of prediction performance of a random forest model using CV
==Other features==
  * [[Mclustering Model based clustering]] using *mclust*
