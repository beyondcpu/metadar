Welcome! This is a package under construction. So, it is not yet formally defined as a package that one could install in R like standard R packages. Partly as a consequence, it does not have the R style documentation.

The way to use this package is therefore to just download the sources, source the scripts that you need and use the functions there in. The best place to start getting familiar with the package is the 'examples' folder. I will keep adding more and more examples whenever I get some free time.
