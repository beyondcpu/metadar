#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

Welcome! This is a package under construction. So, it is not yet formally defined as a package that one could install in R like standard R packages. Partly as a consequence, it does not have the R style documentation.

The way to use this package is therefore to just download the sources, source the scripts that you need and use the functions there in. The best place to start getting familiar with the package is the 'examples' folder. I will keep adding more and more examples whenever I get some free time. I will soon update this page to list all the functions of this package.

==What can you do with this package (to be updated still)==
  * One-way anova and post-hoc test (Tukey Honestly Significant Differences).
  * Two-way anova and post-hoc test (Tukey Honestly Significant Differences).
  * T-test for each variable in the data set.
  * Fold changes for each variable in the data set.
  * Area under the ROC curve for each variable in the data set.
  * Correlation of each variable with a selected variable of interest.
  * Correlation between every pair of variables in a data set.
  * Correlation between variables in two data sets (i.e. every variable in data set 1 versus every variable in data set 2)
  * A classification model using logistic regression
  * A classification model using random forest
  * Evaluation of prediction performance of a logistic regression using cross validation
  * Evaluation of prediction performance of a random forest model using CV
