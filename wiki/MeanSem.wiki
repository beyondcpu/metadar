#summary A function to calculate mean and standard error of mean

= Introduction =

The function `meanSem` allows to calculate mean value and standard error of mean for each feature in a `Dataset` object for two or more groups of samples.

= Function interface =

{{{meanSem(Object, covariate, is.logged=TRUE, log.base=2)}}}
  * `Object`: an object of class `Dataset`. The mean values and standard errors of mean are calculated for each feature of this data set. This is a required argument.
  * `covariate`: a string specifying the name of the sample metadata column that has the group variable. The specified column should have a factor with two or more levels. This is a required argument.
  * is.logged: a logical value specifying if the `Object` has the measurements in log-scale. When missing, the default value of this argument is FALSE, meaning that data are not in log-scale. If the data are  in log-scale, the mean values are provided in the absolute scale (i.e. transformed back from log using the log.base). Thus, when `is.logged = TRUE`, effectively, geometric means of absolute values are calculated.
  * log.base: if the data was in log-scale, the base of the logarithm. The default value is 2.

= Note =

When the data is in log-scale, the interpretation of SEM is quite different from usual. The limits should then expressed not as {{{mean Â± SEM}}}, but as `mean */ SEM`. Therefore, when data is in log-scale, presenting mean and confidence interval for mean is more appropriate.
