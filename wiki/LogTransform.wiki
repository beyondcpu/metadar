#summary Functions to transform the data into log-scale

= Introduction =

The functions `log`, `log2`, and `log10` can be used to transform a `Dataset` object into a log-scale.

= Function interface =
{{{log(x, base=exp(1))}}}
{{{log2(x)}}}
{{{log10(x)}}}
  * `x`: an object of class `Dataset` (or numeric or a complex vector as in `log` function of the R `base` package)
  * `base`: a positive or complex number: the base with respect to which logarithms are computed. Defaults to e=exp(1).
