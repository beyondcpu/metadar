#summary T-test for every continuous variable in a dataset with respect to every binary variable in another dataset.

= Introduction =

Function `allpairsTTest` allows calculation of a t-test between every variable in one dataset and every variable in a second dataset when the dataset has real-valued variables and the second dataset has binary variables.


= Function interface =

{{{allpairsTTest(RealValuedDataset, BinaryDataset, ...)}}}
  * `RealValuedDataset`: an object of class `Dataset` in which the features are real-valued e.g. concentration or abundance levels of molecules.
  * `BinaryDataset`: an object of class `Dataset` in which the feaures are binary e.g. presence or absence of a bacterial DNA.
  * `...`: optional additional arguments to pass on to `t.test` function
