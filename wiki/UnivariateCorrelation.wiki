#summary Computes correlation coefficient of every feature in Dataset with a phenotype variable

= Introduction =

The function `univariateCorrelation` allows us to compute correlation coefficient of each feature in the `Dataset` object with a target phenotype variable of interest.

= Function interface =

{{{univariateCorrelation(Object, covariate, ...)}}}
  * `Object`: an object of class `Dataset`.
  * `covariate`: a character indicating the name of a column of sample metadata or a numeric vector containing the target phenotype variable of interest.
  * `...`: additional arguments for cor.test function. Please check the help document of cor.test function. All additional arguments except `alternative` can be passed (this function always uses `alternative="two.sided"`).
