#summary Two-way analysis of variance to test the main and interaction effects of two independent variables

= Introduction =

The function _twoWayAnova_ allows us to perform two-way analysis of variance for each feature in a `Dataset` object using two categorical treatment variables. The result would indicate the main effects of both treatment variables and interaction between the treatment variables.

= Function interface =

{{{twoWayAnova(Object, covariate1, covariate2)}}}
  * `Object`: An object of the class `Dataset`.
  * `covariate1`: the name of the column in sample metadata giving the first independent variable
  * `covariate2`: the name of the column in sample metadata giving the first independent variable

= Available signatures =

  # {{{twoWayAnova("Dataset", "character", "character")}}} i.e. all three arguments are provided in a function call.

= Example =

Let `dataset` be an object of `Dataset` class and let "C1" and "C2" be the names of sample metadata columns. The function call goes as follows
{{{
aovresult <- twoWayAnova(dataset, "C1", "C2")
}}}

= Result =

The result of the `twoWayAnova` (`aovresult` in the example above) is a list of three data frame object each of which contain in its each row results for each variable in the `Dataset` object. The names of the data frame items of the list are
  * `BigResultTable`: contains all results i.e. all items in the other two data frames explained below
  * `RatiosTable`: mean values for all groups and fold changes corresponding to the main effects and corresponding to every pair of groups
  * `PvalsTable`:  p-values corresponding to each main effect, interaction effect and the post-hoc comparison of pairs of groups
